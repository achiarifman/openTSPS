 		* Processing library simplified, friendlier 
	* WebSockets 100% supported
	* new property in WebSockets / OSC: "highest"

* Source
	* Major refactor! 
		* Thanks to James George (http://github.com/obviousjim) for tons of help with initial ofxCv refactor
	* New interchangeable "Source" and "Processor" classes
		* Allows you to easily add new Camera sources to TSPS or swap in a completely different Processor (default is ofxCv)
		* Kinect, VideoGrabber, VideoPlayer, and OpenNI Source examples are included
			* OpenNI example (standalone/openni) demonstrates how to add a custom Source
		* ofxCv, ofxOpenCv and (partial) ofxOpenNI Processor examples included in source
			* note: only ofxCv Processor is supported, but other classes show you how to write + swap in your own Processor
	* Much simpler to set up!

1.2.2 (5/10/12 - Mac Only)
* Added loading + playing video files through the GUI
* Using the LAB's ofxLibwebsockets addon to function as a WebSocket server and/or client

* Updates to the standalone multi-camera application, which now isn't quite as terrible to use.

1.2 (1/31/12 - Mac Only)

* Updated OSC Message Sending format
* Added leading slash 
* Removed "PersonMoved" message, no only PersonUpdated is sent on every frame
